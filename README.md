# PimpMyPrompt
This repository contains all the file needed to mimic the agnoster theme for zsh but using bash. It also provides some other feature like the username and the date / time of execution of a command. The cool thing about this repo and this bashrc file is that you can use them throught SSH using the command *s* 

## Prerequisites
bash 4.2 or greater

##Optional feature
custom .vimrc file for Vim8

## Installation
Just **run ./install.sh in the cloned folder** and you will be ready to go!

##Using *s*
Use it like you will use ssh command. Type `s foo@bar` and you will be connected with the .sshrc provided in the repo (which is almost a copy of the provided .bashrc), so you will mainain all your aliases!
